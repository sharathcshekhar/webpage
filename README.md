My personal webpage
=============
This webpage was origninally based on Initio - Free, multipurpose html5
template, although I have customized it for my needs.

Homebrewing
-----------
The homebrewing page is backed up a small javascript which displays the recipes
in beerXML format as a HTML Table.
You can modify and re use the script (beer.js). The
script is limited in functionality as it cannot calculate the expected SRM or the IBU
based on the list of ingredients. I hope to add these someday. If you do, please
let me know.
